# Gradient-Descent-in-TensorFlow
Letting the gradients flow backwards
This is a simple demonstration of how to manually calculate gradients from losses in TensorFlow and apply them to the model to perform gradient descent. Though a small code, the procedure I have seen is found complicated by many. Just keeping in case someone needs it someday in the future.
We live to be productive. :)
